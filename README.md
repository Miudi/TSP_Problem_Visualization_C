# Travelling salesman problem Visualization

## Description
This project is aimed at finding the shortest path between planets in a given space using various algorithms, including the Closest Neighbor and Brute Force methods. It provides a graphical interface for adding and visualizing planets, as well as calculating and displaying optimal routes.

## Date

## Dependencies
- Allegro 4.2.2

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository.
2. Compile the code using a C compiler compatible with Allegro.
3. Run the executable file generated.

## Usage
- Left click to add a new planet.
- Press the space bar to calculate the route using the Brute Force method.
- Press 'B' to draw the Brute Force solution.
- Press 'N' to draw the Closest Neighbor solution.
- Press 'S' to draw the standard not sorted solution.
